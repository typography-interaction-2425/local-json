# Working With Data

> [Example/demo](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/week/24/#working-with-data) similar to what we did [with Are&#46;na](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/week/18/#the-are-na-api)—but now working with a JSON file within your project. You could use this as a model for an “API” of your own data.
